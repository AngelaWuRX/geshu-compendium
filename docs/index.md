Welcome 👋  
This is a small “compendium” of ideas I think every CS/ML person should actually understand,
instead of just asking an AI to do it for them.

The structure is **topic-based**, inspired by berkeley courses I've taken, but the goal is a standalone learning path.


## Topics

### Data Structures
Arrays, lists, trees, hash maps, graphs, and how they show up in real systems + interviews.  
Roughly modeled on classic “data structures” courses, but written from my own perspective.

### Efficient Algorithms
Dynamic programming, greedy, flows, reductions, NP-completeness.  
Includes notes on how these ideas connect to common problem-solving patterns and LeetCode-style questions.

### Networks
Graph/network algorithms beyond the basic.  

### Algorithms in the Real World
Optimization, geometry and meshing, biology, cryptography.  
Heavily influenced by CMU 15-183.


## Resources

Short “math prereq” refresh notes for people who are not math majors but still need the tools:

- Linear algebra for ML  
- Probability / random variables  
- Optimization basics  
- Pointers to resources like *Math for Machine Learning* and similar references


## Blog

Short paper notes:

- key ideas in plain language  
- what I found interesting or weird  
- what I don’t fully understand yet  
- one naive extension or question

This is more “learning log” than “research blog”.


## How to read this

- **Starting from scratch?**  
  Begin with **Topics → Data Structures**, then move into **Efficient Algorithms**.

- **Brushing up for interviews / research / work?**  
  Jump between **Data Structures / Efficient Algorithms** and the **Resources** section.

If you’re an instructor/TA and see something that shouldn’t be public, please open an issue or contact me — I’ll fix it.
